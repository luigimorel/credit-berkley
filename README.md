### Introduction

This project was built as a test task to further solidify my knownledge about ReactJS and it's inner workings. (WIP - I hope I will finish this soon.)

### Setup Scripts

I used `yarn` as the package manager.

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

#### `yarn add `

Add all the project dependencies.

### Routes

Since some interfaces are can not be accessed via clicks, here are the routes that can be used to navigate the app.

```bash
/sec-signup
/create-account
/reset-password
/find-account
/feed
/dashboard
/messenger
/secondary-feed
```
